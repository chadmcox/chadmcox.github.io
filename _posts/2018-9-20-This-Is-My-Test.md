title: this is my test!

This is a new test that is going to show off how the code blocks work.  this has not been a fun process

this does something:
``` powershell
get-service -name w32time
get-process | stop-process | select 1 `
  name, something
stop-service
get-service -name w32time
get-process | stop-process | select 1 `
  name, something
stop-service
get-service -name w32time
get-process | stop-process | select 1 `
  name, something
stop-service
get-service -name w32time
get-process | stop-process | select 1
  name, something
stop-service
get-service -name w32time
get-process | stop-process | select 1
  name, something
stop-service
get-service -name w32time
get-process | stop-process | select 1
  name, something
stop-service
```




this does something else:
```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```
